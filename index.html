<center><p>I am hardworking and love to challenge myself. These two traits have allowed me to join
 the National Society of Leadership and Success, make the Dean's List, and open my own 
 Etsy shop. I enjoy studying marketing and graphic design at the University of Maine. 
 I have gained experience from my courses at the University of Maine in marketing research,
 creative cloud programs, public speaking and working with others.</p></center>
